Edge Computing Excellence:
Essential Workers for News Sites:
javascript
// Real-time Content Injection Worker
addEventListener('fetch', event => {
  event.respondWith(handleRequest(event.request))
})

async function handleRequest(request) {
  const response = await fetch(request)
  const rewriter = new HTMLRewriter()
    .on('head', new HeadHandler())
    .on('script[type="application/ld+json"]', new SchemaHandler())
  
  return rewriter.transform(response)
}

class SchemaHandler {
  element(element) {
    // Inject AI-optimized NewsArticle schema
    const schema = {
      "@context": "https://schema.org",
      "@type": "NewsArticle",
      "headline": "{{dynamic}}",
      "datePublished": new Date().toISOString(),

Cloudflare Workers deployed for smart routing and forced HTTPS, optimizing crawl and discovery (including rare edge-case handlers).
Cloudflare News Sitemap Enhancer: Workers enforce up-to-date, AI-readable news sitemaps across all domains (la.curations.org, curatedla.xyz, la.curations.cc). Workers can inject JSON-LD, OpenGraph, and NewsArticle schema in real-time.
AI Listeners: Experimental Workers monitor AI referrers (Perplexity, Googlebot, Apple News), adapting responses or adding index-friendly structured data.
Breadcrumb/Event/Venue Schema: Enable full Event, Place, BreadcrumbList support for instant eligibility in Google Events panels and Apple Maps News events.
Federated ActivityPub (Ghost+Labs) ensures every post can be auto-surfaced in search, Mastodon feeds, and Google Discover/Ambient Experiences.
Rare Capabilities (Beta/Upcoming):
AI-powered request classifiers route traffic to localized sitemaps, preventing crawl cannibalization and maximizing index freshness across all five domains.
Structured discovery manifest for AI and browser preloading (Workbox, instant fetch for Perplexity/AI listeners).
Automated venue and event discovery‚Äîparse iCal, Eventbrite, and RSS into live Event Schema, badge locations, and venue cross-linking.
Responsive error handling tailored for News Partners and AI bots (e.g., 451/429 response codes for overload mitigation without human penalty).
‚ÄúSmart redirect‚Äù worker (e.g., curations-la-master-redirect) harmonizes domain canonicalization‚Äîanchors citations and reduces index dilution.
Ghost Labs: Activate Portal for smart UI signups; use ActivityPub for federated distribution.
Ghost Main UI Advanced: Tag and filter system supports live topic trends, subscribe modals, and direct-to-inbox CTAs.
GitHub ‚Üî Cloudflare: Deploy Workers via GitHub Actions; maintain ‚Äútokenized‚Äù newsletter structure for machine and human curation.
Schedule scripts from GitHub to auto-push event schema/updates to all domains each night.
Advanced/Trusted Sourcing & Board Domination (Discovery/AIs)
Routinely fetch and feature trending user queries (Reddit /r/AskLosAngeles, DoLA, Instagram, TikTok).
Aggregate lesser-known sources (community newsletters, LA local blogs, Nextdoor) for ‚Äúhidden‚Äù event tips.
Target ‚ÄúGood Vibes‚Äù leaderboard presence by registering as publisher with all Big Search and News partners; pursue manual submission to Perplexity Discovery, Google News, Apple News.
Remain active in community feedback cycles for schema adoption and news partner improvements; leverage Labs/Beta features for rapid adoption.

10. Unique Action Points for ‚ÄúGood Vibe Domination‚Äù
Run quarterly event schema validation sweeps via Google and Cloudflare tools.
Launch a ‚ÄúCurator in Residence‚Äù guest slot‚Äîrotate well-known locals monthly.
Automate dual-format output: human-editable and AI-optimized (JSON-LD + plain text).
Enable ‚Äúinstant digest‚Äù for major AI agents‚Äîcreate One-Line LA feed, designed to be scraped and cited.
Develop a public ‚ÄúVibes API‚Äù available for other apps, news tools, and AI to ingest and cite.
