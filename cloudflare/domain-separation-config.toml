# CurationsLA Domain Separation Configuration
# This configuration ensures complete separation between curations.cc and la.curations.cc

# Original curations.cc workers and routes remain unchanged:

# - curations-sitemap-generator (ORIGINAL - Agency services) 
# - curations-discovery-endpoints (ORIGINAL - Business endpoints)
# Routes: curations.cc/* (UNCHANGED)
# Purpose: Marketing Agency (UNCHANGED)

# SEPARATION VERIFICATION
# ============================================================================

# Domain Separation Confirmed:
# ‚úÖ curations.cc workers: COMPLETELY SEPARATE (no shared workers)
# ‚úÖ curations.cc routes: COMPLETELY SEPARATE (different domains)
# ‚úÖ curations.cc data: COMPLETELY SEPARATE (different KV namespaces)
# ‚úÖ curations.cc analytics: COMPLETELY SEPARATE (different datasets)
