```python
GOOD_VIBES_KEYWORDS = [
    # Openings & Launches
    'opening', 'launch', 'debut', 'premiere', 'grand opening',
    
    # Community & Celebration  
    'community', 'celebrate', 'festival', 'achievement', 'success',
    
    # Culture & Arts
    'art', 'exhibition', 'concert', 'performance', 'creative',
    
    # Positive Activities
    'free', 'family-friendly', 'fun', 'amazing', 'inspiring'
]
```

### Blocked Keywords (Auto-Filter)
```python
BLOCKED_KEYWORDS = [
    # Crime & Violence
    'murder', 'shooting', 'robbery', 'crime', 'arrest',
    
    # Politics & Controversy
    'political', 'protest', 'activist', 'controversy',
    
    # Negative Business
    'bankruptcy', 'closure', 'layoffs', 'scandal', 'failure'
]
```
